I am a theoretical physicist now working as a data scientist and statistician. I specialize in statistics, mathematical modelling and machine learning. I'm currently focussed on deep learning for biomedical image tasks.

I have a PhD in theoretical physics from Imperial College London and significant international experience at research institutes across Europe. 

I like Python, R and problems that aren't easy to solve.

My website lives on Github [here](https://smyth7.github.io).
